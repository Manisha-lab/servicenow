# Set Priority of Incident if Caller is VIP

Few customers ask for this functionality like, if the caller is a VIP, the Incident priority should be set to a specific level and make the fields read only.

If the caller is changed back to a non VIP user, make the Impact and Urgency editable and flash the priority field for user attention to set it back to normal.
