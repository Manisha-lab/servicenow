
ServiceNow administrators often need to create new users and assign them the appropriate roles and group memberships. This can be a time-consuming process, especially if the user needs to be granted access to a large number of groups and roles.

To make this process easier, you can create a UI action to clone the roles and groups of one user to another user. This UI action can be added to the User form, so that it is easily accessible to administrators.
